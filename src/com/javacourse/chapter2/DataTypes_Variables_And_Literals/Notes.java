            To Calculate Size Of Data Type Easy Method: -(2^bits)/2 to (2^bits)/2 - 1
            See For Integer:
            Look At The Integer Docs: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html
            1) Calculate Bits: byte*bits 4*8=32 | -(2^32)/2 to (2^32)/2 - 1
            Q) What is 4 here??
            Ans) Byte, In Integer
            Q) What is 8 here??
            Ans) 1 Byte = 8 Bits
            Then We Multiplied Them(4*8) And Found The Ans Which = 32
            Then The Formula: -(2^bits)/2 to (2^bits)/2 - 1
            And So We Got Integer Range: -2147483648 to 2147483647
